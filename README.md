# Regex-Matching-Python-Application
It is a  task to replicate the core functionality of the website regex101.com. This entails creating a web application that allows users to input a test string and a regular expression (regex) and displays all the matches found.

->A "regex matching web app development project" refers to creating a web application where users can input text and a regular expression (regex) pattern, and the app will then search the text to identify and highlight parts that match the specified regex pattern, essentially allowing users to easily find and manipulate text based on defined patterns.
->Functionality:
Users provide a text string to search within. 
Users input a regex pattern to match against the text. 
The app displays the matched parts of the text, often highlighting them visually. 
May include features like capturing groups to extract specific information from the matched tex
->Use cases:
Data validation: Checking if user input like email addresses or phone numbers follow a specific format. 
Text analysis: Extracting specific information from large text documents like names, dates, or locations. 
Code editing: Finding and replacing patterns within code

Technical aspects:
Regex libraries: Most programming languages have built-in regex libraries to handle pattern matching. 
Front-end development: Creating a user interface for input fields and displaying results. 
Back-end development (optional): For advanced features like data storage or complex regex operations
